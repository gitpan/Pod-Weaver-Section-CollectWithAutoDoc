NAME
    Pod::Weaver::Section::CollectWithAutoDoc - Section to gather specific
    commands and add auto-generated documentation

VERSION
    version 1.100881

SYNOPSIS
    In "weaver.ini":

        [CollectWithAutoDoc / METHODS]
        command = method

OVERVIEW
    Given the configuration from the synopsis, this plugin will start off by
    gathering and nesting any "=method" commands found in the document.
    Those commands, along with their nestable content, will be collected
    under a "=head1 METHODS" header and placed in the correct location in
    the output stream. Their order will be preserved as it was in the source
    document.

    Additionally, this plugin can add auto-generated method documentation
    collected via Sub::Documentation. Class::Accessor::Installer supports
    Sub::Documentation, and Class::Accessor::Complex, for example, uses
    Class::Accessor::Installer.

    This auto-documentation is expected to be generated at run-time, when
    the module is loaded. So this plugin loads the module that is being
    documented, inspects the generated documentation, and adds them to the
    appropriate "=method" elements.

    This plugin subclasses Pod::Weaver::Section::Collect.
